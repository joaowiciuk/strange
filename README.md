# About
A probabilistic Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) tool for decision makers.

## How to
### Use
Check `src/strange/main.py`. Run it with:
```bash
python3 -m src.strange.main
```
### Contribute
Convince me of
- The relevance of your suggestion(s)
- The correctness of your changes (if any)

For the sake of project evolution it will be assumed your suggestions are irrelevant and your changes are incorrect.

## Author
I don't know Python. For this reason this project relies heavily on AI and what have been called "vibe coding" (2025).

## Roadmap

- [x] Initial project structure
- [ ] Probabilistic capabilities (weights and scores are distributions)
- [ ] Monte Carlo simulations
- [ ] Uncertainty analysis: hint system for weights and scores (how variances influence the results?)
